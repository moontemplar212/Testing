# Testing Types

## Functional Testing

### Unit testing:
  * Individual units / modules / functions of code action

Unit testing is the most basic form of testing where single functions usually with one or a few inputs and a single output are tested to make sure they meet requirements specifications and documentation. What differentiates this type of testing from others is that functions should be tested in isolation without any dependancies or interactions outside of it's own scope. This enables confirmation that the function works as intended by itself.

> Example
><br>
><br>
> function (a, b) {<br>
> &ensp; return a + b;<br>
>}<br>

The above function is a simple sum of two elements a and b. The scope of the function is that it takes two inputs and returns one output. There are no outside dependencies such as global variables or reliance on other functions. 

### Integration testing:
  * Many individual code actions

Integration testing is 

### Interface testing:
  * Connections between parts of a system

### System testing:
  * Entire code base

### Acceptance testing:
  * User validation of the system

### Regression testing:
  * Checking for regression in parts of the system where changes have been made elsewhere

### Alpha/Beta testing: 
  * Testing two version of the same feature

### Confirmation testing:
  * Checking the defect fix produces the correct result

### Sanity testing:
  * High level critical functionality

### Smoke testing: 
  * Brief high level critical functionality

### Exploratory testing:
  * Non-structured testing

### Checklist based testing:
  * Structured testing using a list of items

### Blackbox testing:
  * Not knowing the interal structure of the system

### Whitebox testing:
  * Knowing the internal structure of the system

### End to end testing:
  * Full application pathway

### API testing:
  * abc

### UI testing:
  * Front end browser based elements

## Non-functional Testing

### Performance testing:
  * Platform responsiveness, transaction handling

### Security testing:
  * How secure is the platform

### Compliance testing:
  * Comply with laws, regulations, industry standards

### Localisation testing:
  * Values and timezone specific to region

### Volume testing:
  * How much volume can the platform handle, users, transactions, requests

### Load testing:
  * How much load can the platform handle

### Stress testing:
  * How does the platform respond at peak load

### Destructive testing:
  * How does the platform handle too many transactions, requests

### Usability testing:
  * Is the platform user friendly?

### Portability testing:
  * How portable is the platform to other hardware, software, architectures, platforms?

### Recovery testing:
  * Ability of system to recover from backups, restore points

### Reliability testing:
  * Uptime, how reliable is the platform?

### Maintainability testing:
  * How maintainable is the platform, how easy is it to implement change or fix issues?

### Accessibility testing:
  * Colourblind, epileptic, disabilities

### Browser compatibility testing:
  * How does the platform respond on different browsers

### Backwards compatability testing:
  * How backwards compatable are versions of the platform, do new versions work with older versions?
