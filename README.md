# So you want to be a software tester?

But you are unsure how to go about becoming one.

Then this guide is for you.

If you think that software testing can be a rewarding and fulfilling career then you would be right. 

Because I test software for a living. And I love my job ❤.

Read on as we cover the following topics:

* What is software testing?
* What exactly does a software tester do?
* Skills for software testing

## What is software testing?

Software testing is the process of verifying and validating that a software program meets the requirements specifications and produces the desired results for the end user, whether that is business, an individual or even another computer. At the end of the day you will help contrubute to what is a high quality software product.

You might think this only involves finding defects and ensuring the end product is bug free but there are plently of other things that you will do as a software tester.

## What does a software tester do?

First and foremost, as a software tester you will be finding defects in the software product, that cause bugs in the code ( there is an interesting history behind this ) which ultimately leads to errors. Errors are results different from the desired outcomes or the expected results. 

Now what the heck does all that mean?

Defects, bugs, errors?

The term bug in software is used commonly to cover all three above, but there are important distinctions between them which we will see later.

So what might you get up to when not focusing on destroying a developers hard work?

There are lots of things other than finding defects that you will get up to. This might include producing documentation, collaborating with colleagues and providing feedback, summarising and reporting results or even helping to train the next generation of software testers. Gee, it sounds like a lot, so what are some of the core skills you need as a software tester?

## Skills for software testing

There are lots of skills that you need for software testing but the number one skill is this:

> An open mind

Yes, that is right, an open mind. You must leave your assumptions and preconceptions at the door and look at things with a fresh pair of eyes.

If this sounds hard, then you are right, it is. 

Even harder than developing code? Damn right.

Developers do have to think about what they are doing and try to cover common cases and even some tricky edge scenarios.

But as a software tester you will be thinking about all of them.

What this means is that the number one thing that software testing teaches you is to think critically!

Apart from this some common industry knowledge includes:

# Programming

A knowledge of programming is not required but certainly useful for testing software products. A programming language is one that is is able to implement logic and be translated to machine code. You might know of the following:

* C
* C++
* C# ( C-sharp or Microsoft Java )
* Java
* JavaScript
* Php
* Ruby
* Python
* Julia
* Go
* Rust

* HTML ( Haha, just kidding, logic requires that we are able to use variables and write conditional statements, which is not possible in HTML )

And many more.

There is no one best programming langauge. You have to pick the right tool for the right job. Some languages are better suited for desktop applications while others are used for web applications. Still others can be used to write code that your computer runs on.

# Tools and services

There are a lot of tools that help you do your job these days. The following is not exhaustive but can be assumed knowledge in most workplaces.

* Version Control System ( VCS ): Git, Mercurial, Perforce, etc.
* Cloud hosted respository: Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab, etc.
* Interactive Development Environment ( IDE ): Visual Studio, IntelliJ, VSCode, etc.
* Test management software: JIRA, etc.

A software tester will be using these tools and services on a daily basis so it pays to know them well.

# Soft skills ( or how to people )

If there is nothing else that you have taken away, then remember this. 

Your soft skills are what will set you apart from other people in your organisation or to put it another way everyone working in IT will know about computers to a greater or lesser degree.

As a software tester, this is most often shown in the way that you colloborate with your colleagues and provide feedback to the developer/s of the software you are testing.

Being able to articulate in a well structured and personable manner the issues you have identified in an objective way is crucial to collaborating with and maintaining working relationships with your colleagues.

Be nice or no dice.
